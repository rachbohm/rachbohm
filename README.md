### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Rachel Bohmbach.

Iâ€™m a dedicated software engineer who enjoys solving puzzles and getting to the root of error messages! I love working with others to find the most effective and creative solutions. I love to dive continually deeper into problems and codebases. I have experience working in JavaScript, Python, React, Redux, Flask, Node.js, Express, Sequelize, SQL, and SQLAlchemy. In my free time, I enjoy many forms of fitness, nature, cooking new recipes, and hanging out with my husband and our feline cohabitants!
