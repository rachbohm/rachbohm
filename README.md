### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Rachel Bohmbach.

Iâ€™m a dedicated software engineer who enjoys solving puzzles and getting to the root of error messages! I graduated from App Academy's full-stack coding bootcamp. My top two languages are JavaScript and Python. Before coding, I worked in healthcare. In my free time, I enjoy many forms of fitness, nature, cooking, and spending time with my family.
